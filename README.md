# Image-Processing-Project
This repository contains the project details, code and a small video demo on the project related to our course Image processing


Our project is mainly a comparison of IncrptionNetV3 deep learning model, MobileNetV2 deep learning and our custom CNN model on brain tumour classification

**Setup procedure:**

**Step 1:**

Download the dataset from the given link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection

**Step 2:**

Load the three workbooks in local anaconda jupyter notebook or in Google colab.

**Step 3:**

Load the datasets in all the three workbooks by configuring the path location

**Step 4:**

Create new folders for storing the augmented images

**Step 5:**

Run the code cells one by one and see the result
